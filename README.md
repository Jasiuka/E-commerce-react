# E-Commerce shop project using React.js

## This project idea is not mine. It's main project of ZTM (Zero To Mastery) course in Udemy. 

In this project I learned:
+ What is React.js and how to work with it, architecture of projects.
+ React libraries:
  + Redux.
  + Redux toolkit.
  + React context.
  + Reducers.
  + Redux-Sagas.
  + Redux-thunk.
 + Firebase / Firestore.
 + Stripe.
 + React Query

Also I've added some features by myself like:
+ Profile page.
+ Username change.
+ Profile picture.
+ Profile picture change (using links).

 This was a challenging course, but I made it, learnt a lot. And this course is start of my React.js development path.
